            <p>These logos that you see on these few pages all have two things in common. First, they’re beautiful, well-designed, professional logos that are sure to grab the eye of a website visitor. And second, they’re for offices that don’t exist!</p>
            <p>Our mock logos help web designers fill in screenshot designs or offer a templated logo for clients who currently have none of their own. And as great as our mock logos were, they were in need of a refresh. That’s why our design team worked hard to make some new mock logos, with the newest design standards and sensibilities, so that each of our clients can have a website that pops!</p>

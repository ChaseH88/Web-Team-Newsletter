          <h2>Mega Menu</h2>
          <p>We’ve made great leaps forward with our website features over the years, but until recently, one aspect of our web designs has remained relatively unchanged: our menus. For years, clients had very few options when it came to their website menus besides whether they were aligned horizontally or vertically. But thanks to our talented designers and developers, clients have some fantastic new menu choices, including “overlay menus”.</p>
          <!-- <p>Overlay menus are a great way to make a site more aesthetic and engaging for patients, incorporating icons, images and animations to clearly indicate what type of content is on pages, while catching the eye of visitors and beckoning them to discover more.</p> -->
          <p>On the About Faces and Braces site, at <a href="https://www.aboutfacesandbraces.com/" target="_blank">https://www.aboutfacesandbraces.com/</a>, you can see how icons and images can instantly make a site menu more varied and visually pleasing. Dr. Alex Johnson’s “mega menu” on <a href="http://dralexjohnson.televox.west.com/" target="_blank">http://dralexjohnson.televox.west.com/</a>, however, showcases how even a traditional text-based menu can be made more engaging by using layers and animation to overlay the entire menu over a site, unfurling the entire site’s content for a user within a second.</p>
          <p>Nothing makes clients happier than choices for their site, and with these new technically advanced and visually appealing menus, clients have more – and better – choices than ever!</p>

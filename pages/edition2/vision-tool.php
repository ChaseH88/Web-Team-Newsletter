          <p>Can you imagine what your world would look like if you had cataracts? Or macular degeneration? Many of us have heard about these different eye conditions, but are not aware of how each condition affects a personâ€™s vision. With our Vision Simulator, you can see exactly how certain eye diseases, like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and cataracts, can impair your vision. </p>
          <p>The Vision Simulator features a series of pictures and slider that shows you the progression of each condition. It also has the ability to change the image to be viewed at different distances.</p>
          <p>For ophthalmic practices, this is an important tool that will help give their patients a better understanding of certain eye diseases. It is also a tool to encourage patients to be proactive in the care of their eyes -through routine eye exams, wearing proper eyewear and continuing treatment prescribed by their physician.</p>
